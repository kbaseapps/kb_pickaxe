    <p>This is a Narative application for running <a href="https://github.com/JamesJeffryes/MINE-Database/blob/master/minedatabase/pickaxe.py">
    Pickaxe </a> which generates novel compounds based enzymatic and spontanios
     reaction rules. This tool originally written by <a href="http://jamesjeffryes.github.io/">
     James Jeffryes.</a></p>

     <p>PickAxe iteratively applies a set of SMARTS reacion rules which represent
     generalized enzymatically catalyzed and spontanios reactions to a pool of
     compounds. As novel compounds are generated, they are added to the
     reaction pool until the maximum number of iterations have elapsed. The
     result is a directed (but not acyclic) graph that branches from a small
     number of source compounds to a large number of daughter compounds with
     each transition labeled with its reaction type. The reaction rules are
     hand-curated by examining common reaction motifs and cover all classes of
     chemistry in the Enzyme Commission (EC) Classification system as well as a
     set of spontanios reactions. The rules vary in their specificity and thus
     the breadth and number of transformations they produce as a result of the
     multiplicity of ways a chemical transformation can be generalized. This
     approch has found a variety of applications including predicting
     xenodegradation pathways, synthesis of value added compounds, and
     simulation of thermodynamic landscapes.</p>
